Image Positioning Art Web Application

Now a day’s developer Challenges facing while developing powerful web Application i.e use of many libraries for each of the function in the project. But it’s too difficulties to manage the libraries files, and site pages also get a heavy load. Sometimes because of heavy load sites pages and use of heavyweight application libraries files, web application not able function its operation properly. While developing this web Application I also face the same problem if we using JQuery libraries or any other javascript packages. But I get a solution to use Vanilla JS for building this powerful web application. 
For this, I just develop a Web Application for the art of positioning the image, with its size, its rotation, change images background color etc. Actually, I have developed this application for our project “MyFlatz”. It’s an online gaming Platform on which there is also a platform “Studio” where visitors can design his own personal Flatz, so in that there is a step for “Flatz Image positioning Art” for which I have developed this web App. For this, I have used Vanilla JS Programming. It’s very creative, fast, and lightweight, less use of libraries files, fun too for developing web Application. 
Software Requirements: 
Editor: Sublime Text, Programming Language: Vanilla JS, Web Browser: I have to use Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition but there is no recitation we can use any browser to run this tool. 

The following Steps are discussed:
1. Function for zoom in image: In these we can zoom in size of image by clicking on button “Zoom In”.
2. Function for zoom out image: In these we can zoom out size of image by clicking on button “zoom out”.
3. Function for undo image: In these we can undo image, by clicking on button “undo”. By this function we can back to “zoom in” previously perform operation.
4. Function for redo image: In these we can redo image, by clicking on button “Redo”. By this function we can back to “Zoom out” previously perform operation
5. Function for flip vertical image: In these we can flip image at vertical direction, by clicking on button “Flip Vertical”.
6. Function for flip horizontal image: In these we can flip image at horizontal direction, by clicking on button “Flip Horizontal”.
7. Now for same flip vertical and horizontal image we can perform undo and redo operation. 
8. Function for Rotate image clockwise: In these we can rotate image clockwise, by clicking on button “Rotate Clockwise”.
9. Function for Rotate image Anti clockwise: In these we can rotate image Anti clockwise, by clicking on button “Rotate Anti Clockwise”.
10.Function for change background colour of image: In these we can change image background colour, by clicking on “colour picker”. 

In this web application for all Button functionality I have use Vanilla JS, I not use any Java script libraries, so it is easy to use and light weight.
